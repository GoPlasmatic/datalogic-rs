//! Compile-phase: walk an [`OwnedDataValue`] rule tree into the engine's
//! [`CompiledNode`] representation, with operator-specific specialisations
//! and (when an engine is available) optimisation + constant-folding passes.
//!
//! The entry points live here; the heavy lifting is split across
//! - [`walker`] — the recursive `compile_node` dispatch.
//! - [`operator`] — `var` / `val` / `exists` specialisations.
//! - [`missing`] — `missing` / `missing_some` static path pre-parsing.
//! - [`path_segments`] — shared dot-path parsing.
//! - [`scope`] — the static frame model (which child positions run under a
//!   pushed context frame), shared by scope resolution and the CSE pass.
//! - [`optimize`] — DCE, strength reduction, constant folding.
